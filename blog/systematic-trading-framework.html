                <p>The pendulum of the markets swings forever between euphoria and depression, and for the better part of a decade, my own portfolio swung right along with it.</p>

                <p>If I look back at my track record from 2017 to 2023, it serves as a perfect case study in the psychology of the retail trader. I began prudently enough with ETFs, but like so many, I was seduced by the sirens of the era. I chased the cannabis mania in 2018 and the crypto hype of 2019. In 2020 and 2021, I confused a rising tide with swimming ability, making substantial sums on SPY puts and the post-COVID "free money" rally.</p>

                <p>But as I often say, trees don't grow to the sky. When the environment shifted in 2022 and 2023, my lack of a disciplined framework was exposed. I pivoted to selling options, then ultimately blew up the account during the tech selloff. It was a painful but necessary lesson: <strong>Volatility is not risk, but permanent loss of capital is.</strong></p>

                <p>In 2024, I managed to rise from the ashes with some successful fundamental plays, but I knew I needed a change. I needed to stop guessing and start engineering.</p>

                <h2>The Shift to Systems</h2>
                <p>For years, I watched my father trade futures—specifically the MNQ—with a consistency that baffled me. I was skeptical. I operated under the efficient market hypothesis assumption that "there is no edge," and if systematic trading were truly viable, everyone would be wealthy.</p>

                <p>I was wrong. The edge wasn't just in the math; it was in the discipline.</p>

                <p>Since April 2024, I have partnered with him to build an automated strategy. The results—up 50% year-to-date—have been compelling, but more importantly, the process has been repeatable. We are no longer waking up and asking what the market "feels" like today. We are executing a plan.</p>

                <p>Here is the framework we now use to ensure we are investing, not gambling.</p>

                <h3>1. Strategy Formulation (The Thesis)</h3>
                <p>Before a line of code is written, we must identify the economic rationale. Are we following a trend? Reverting to the mean? Exploiting a statistical arbitrage? We define entry, exit, and—most critically—position sizing. This takes months, not days. If you cannot define the edge, you don't have one.</p>

                <h3>2. Historical Stress Testing</h3>
                <p>We look backward to understand the future. We run backtests not to prove the strategy works, but to find where it breaks. We optimize parameters cautiously, ensuring that a slight change in inputs doesn't destroy the output. If a strategy is too fragile to handle parameter shifts, it is too fragile for the real world.</p>

                <h3>3. The Simulation Phase</h3>
                <p>Paper trading is the dress rehearsal. We run the algorithm in a live, simulated environment for months. This highlights execution bugs and gives us a feel for the "pain points"—the drawdowns that look easy on a spreadsheet but feel terrible in real life.</p>

                <h3>4. Portfolio Fit</h3>
                <p>No asset exists in a vacuum. We analyze how the new algorithm correlates with our existing book. Does it zig when others zag? We then calculate position size based on risk tolerance, not return targets.</p>

                <h3>5. Probationary Deployment</h3>
                <p>We never jump in with both feet. The algorithm enters the live portfolio at half-size for a 90-day probationary period. Only after it survives the rigors of live trading do we graduate it to a full allocation.</p>

                <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
                <p>After years of emotional whiplash, I have learned that the key to survival isn't predicting the future—it's managing your reaction to it.</p>

                <p>Discretionary trading often devolves into a battle against one's own psychology. Systematic trading removes the ego from the equation. It is not a get-rich-quick scheme; it is a discipline.</p>
